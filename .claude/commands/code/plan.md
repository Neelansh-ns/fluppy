# Code Planning Guide

## Overview
This document provides guidelines for planning code changes in the fluppy project.

## Planning Process

1. **Understand the Requirements**
   - Read the issue or feature request carefully
   - Identify the scope of changes needed
   - Document any dependencies or constraints

2. **Analyze the Codebase**
   - Review existing code structure
   - Identify affected modules and files
   - Understand the current implementation

3. **Design the Solution**
   - Create a high-level design
   - Break down the work into smaller tasks
   - Identify potential risks and edge cases

4. **Implementation Plan**
   - List the files that need to be modified
   - Plan the order of changes
   - Adjust the plan accordingly based on findings during implementation

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Define test cases
   - Plan for unit tests and integration tests
   - Ensure adequate test coverage

6. **Review and Validation**
   - Conduct code review
   - Validate against requirements
   - Update documentation as needed

## Best Practices

- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Write clear and concise commit messages
- Update tests along with code changes
- Document any breaking changes
